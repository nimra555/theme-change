        <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
            first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
            environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
            prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
            and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web
            pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and
            DOM.

            The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1.
            Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major
            version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as
            ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation
            refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.

            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or

            a very different syntax, semantic, and use
